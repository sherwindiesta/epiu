                        Republic Act 10173, otherwise known as The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (the “DPA”) sets out the principles that should be followed when processing personal data of any kind. One of the ways in which Makati Medical Center (MakatiMed) can take steps to comply with some of these principles is to ask its employees and house staff to consent to the processing of their employment-related personal data.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an employer, MakatiMed maintains certain personal information about you as part of its general employee records. MakatiMed’s records may include, but are not limited to, your address and contact details, marital status, gender, nationality, educational background, employment application, history with the company, areas of expertise, details of salary and benefits, bank details, performance appraisals and salary reviews, attendance, leave records, working time records, medical records and history, government issued identifications (including driver’s license, Social Security System number, Philhealth number, Tax Identification Number, Professional Regulations Commission), tax records, and other management records. MakatiMed is aware of your personal information in a number of ways - directly from you, from others and otherwise over time through its relationship with you - and may receive and/or retain it in various forms (whether in writing, electronically, or other forms).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MakatiMed uses these information for a variety of personnel administration and employee, work and general business management purposes. For example, information is needed to administer payroll, improve and maintain the administration of employee benefits (such as, but not limited to, leave entitlements, medical and insurance benefits, maternity benefits, legislated benefits, etc.), general office management, performance and salary reviews, administration of the company’s information technology and communications systems, record keeping and compliance with other legal obligations. MakatiMed also uses the information for hospital activities including, but not limited to, Employee Engagement activities (MVP Olympics, MMC Anniversary, CSR Programs, Blood Donation Campaigns, Parties), Climate Surveys, Training Needs Surveys, and other topics that will be of interest to you (company news/announcements, birthday greetings, promotions, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MakatiMed also processes information relating to your health condition which may be considered as sensitive personal data. The specific information that the company holds relating to your health includes your sick leave availments, medical certificates, results of annual physical exams, availment of Philhealth benefits, health or life insurance claims. MakatiMed processes your sensitive personal data, specifically health information for general employment records and benefits administration and management, as well as to comply with statutory obligations under the National Health Insurance Program (Philhealth), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and from time to time with the Department of Health (DOH), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
